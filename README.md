 Extraction of PII from unstructured text is a crucial task[1] in many industries. It is a laborious task that can be automated through the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. Rajitha et.al[1] argue that traditional Supervised machine learning methods like Condition Random Field[2]  and Support Vector Machines, along with extensive feature extraction techniques, were employed to train NER models in the past; however, contemporary advancements in deep learning, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM-RNNs, have emerged as preferred choices for NER model training. These models excel in retaining sequence information and preserving context withinsentences
